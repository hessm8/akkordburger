V2.872 2021-24-01
Replace Datetime.Now with the more efficient Datetime.UtcNow (thank github.com/Ideae for this proposition).
Corrected issue when a noteoff is processed in the attack phase (thank github.com/Ideae for detection and proposition).
Corrected issue with MPTK_TickCurrent. Midi events at this exact tick position was missing, so some midi events could be lost.
